# GenomeBrowser
---

This module implements apps and utilities to enable browsing genomes with [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org/).

The general flow of the main path is like this:
1. Use GenomeFileUtils to convert from a KBase Genome object to a GFF file.
2. Use the JBrowse scripts to convert that file to both a reference sequence file and annotation track file.
3. Package all of those using KBaseReports, and make them accessible through the HTML file server.
4. Run JBrowse pointed at those files as output.

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


This Module was initialized with a generated example App.  To compile and run the
example App implementation, run:

    cd GenomeBrowser
    make          (required after making changes to $module_name.spec)
    kb-sdk test   (will require setting test user account credentials in test_local/test.cfg)

For more help on how to modify, register and deploy the example to KBase, see the
[KBase SDK documentation](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).
